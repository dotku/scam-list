## Senior Advisors

According to the Senior Advisors website, only following number are legit:

* 856.866.8900 (Moorestown, NJ)
* 908.272.1970 (Cranford, NJ)
* 602.996.1549 (Phoenix, AZ)

The company says would try their best effort to identify the call, but it seems not likely, 
cause I got quite a lot call from "Senior Advisors" for years.
